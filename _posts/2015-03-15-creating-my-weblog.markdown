title: Creating my weblog
---

Hi, a couple of years ago I wrote [my personal page][1]. I needed a page were I can put all my contact information and also I wanted to write a small site using nodeJS and angularJS. At the time I knew it didn't make sense put all that together for a contact page, specially if there not any interaction, but i did it anyway just to play with it.

I never included the weblog feature because I never knew what to write about. But this year is different I want to do an experiment. I usually I invest certain amount of personal time to improve my Programming skills. So, I want to see how writing about it affect my learning expirence. For example I could had write a post saying how fun it's working with AngularJS.

Probably I should define an hipotesis and a methodology so I can messure the outcome and everything, but this already sounds too hard. So let's do that later and continue with the thing I had in mind.

##How include my github page to my personal weblog

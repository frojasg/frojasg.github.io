I just started a new course called "A Gentle Introduction to Statistics!" given by [Stanford](https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20144_MATH-11). I pretend to keep a series of post about all the notes and thought during this course.

This course use a [(Discovering Statistics using IBM SPSS Statistics)](http://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Statistics-using-IBM-SPSS/dp/1446249182) as guide text. This text book is pretty big so is hard for me carry it around I'm also reading in parallel [Head First Statistics](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Statistics-Dawn-Griffiths-ebook/dp/B00B797ELQ) because I have it available in ebook format.

So during this first week we will talk about the scientific method and how generate theories and test it. Data collection is vital for testing theories and when we collect the data we need to decide on two things: (1) What to measure, (2) How to measure it.

So we actually measure variables and variable are just things that can change. Most hypothesis can be expressed in terms of two variable: a proposed cause and a proposed variable. For example let's say the following scientific statement "The ```<blink>``` html tag decrease the visit in a site", both cause and outcome are variables.

* __Independent variable__: A variable we think is a cause of some effect. Also know as _predictor variable_ or __explanatory__.
* __Dependent variable__: A variable we think is an effect by changes in a _independent variable_. Also know as _outcome variable_ or __response__.

Once we have defined our variable we need to define _levels of measurement_. Broadly speaking variable can be _categorical_ or _continuous_ and can have different level of measurement and the level we use will depend on the context we are using them.

* __Categorical__: entities are divided into distinct categories
  * __Binary variable__: there are only two categories (e.g. dead or alive)
  * __Nominal variable__: there are more than two categories, with no logical ordering.
  * __Ordinal variable__: The same as nominal variable but the categories have logical order.

* __Continuous__: entities get a distinct score
  * __Interval variable__: equals interval on the variable represent equal differences in the property being measured
  * __Ratio variable__: The same as an interval variable, but the ratios of scores on the scale must also make sense


There will often a discrepancy between the numbers we use to represent the thing we're measuring and the actual value of the thing we're measuring. This discrepancy is know as __measurement error__. When you use a instrument to measure something we expect that the instrument is reliable, meaning that it give you the same result every time under the same conditions and valid, which mean that the instrument measure what it sent out to measure

There are two ways to test a hypothesis: either by observing what naturally happens, this we will call correlational or cross-sectional research; or by manipulating some aspect of the environment and observing the effect it has on the variables that interest us, this is called experimental research.

One of the problems with correlational research is that variables are often measured simultaneously which provide no information about the contiguity between different variables. The second one is that sometimes there are extraneous factors called confounding variables that are not in the main concern of the study, but may be partially responsible for the observed result, because it relate to the predictor/explanatory variable as well as to the outcome/response variable.

TL:DR Identify your independent and dependent variables, define the level of measurement
